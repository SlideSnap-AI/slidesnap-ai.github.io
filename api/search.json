(“Company”, “we”, or “us”) for users of SlideSnap AI (“you”). When you opt in, Apple will charge your Apple ID payment method for subscription fees according to your chosen plan.\nPlease read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand all terms, especially those that limit or exclude our liability. Minors should read this Agreement together with a legal guardian.\nBy enabling auto-renewal you confirm that you have read and agree to this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not enable auto-renewal.\nService DescriptionPrices may vary by region and taxes may apply. The applicable price will be shown in the App Store before you confirm your purchase.\n\nTo make purchasing or renewing SlideSnap AI paid products more convenient, we offer auto-renewable subscriptions through the Apple App Store. By explicitly enabling auto-renewal, you authorize Apple to charge your Apple ID payment method to pay for subscription renewals when renewal conditions are met.\nThis feature applies to all periodically billed subscription products offered by SlideSnap AI.\n\nEnabling Auto-Renewal\nPayment will be charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase.\nYour subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\nYour account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified.\nYou can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings (Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions).\nIf renewal fails for reasons outside the Company’s control (e.g., App Store issues, account limits, insufficient funds), your subscription will be treated as expired and the Company may suspend service. You bear any consequences arising from failure to renew.\n\nPromotions, Pricing and Renewal Rules\nThe Company may, based on business needs or market conditions, adjust pricing, billing&#x2F;renewal standards, or billing&#x2F;renewal methods (collectively, the “Billing&#x2F;Renewal Rules”). For App Store subscriptions, Apple will notify you of any price increase and you can cancel before the new price takes effect.\nIf you obtain subscription time extension via redemption codes or other non-payment methods, the start of auto-renewal shall be deferred until one day before the extended subscription period expires. For App Store purchases, the App Store renewal rules prevail.\n\nCanceling Auto-Renewal\nYou can cancel auto-renewal via: Settings on your Apple device &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions &gt; SlideSnap AI &gt; Cancel Subscription.\nIf OS updates change cancellation paths, contact Apple Support for assistance.\nCancelling auto-renewal revokes your authorization for Apple to automatically charge your Apple ID, but does not affect charges already completed before cancellation took effect.\nRegardless of the reason you stop using a paid product, you must proactively cancel auto-renewal for that product. If you do not cancel and a charge occurs, the Company will continue service for the paid period after a successful charge.\n\nAgreement Amendments\nThe Company may amend this Agreement in response to internet development, legal&#x2F;regulatory changes, or business needs. We will notify you of material changes by appropriate means (in-app notice, announcement, or other channels).\nIf you do not agree to an amendment, you may disable auto-renewal. Continued use of services after notice shall constitute acceptance of the amended Agreement.\n\nGoverning Law and Dispute Resolution\nThe formation, validity, performance, interpretation and dispute resolution of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the People’s Republic of China. If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with mandatory applicable law, that provision shall be interpreted or adjusted to the extent possible while maintaining the original intent; other provisions shall remain in effect.\nParties shall seek to resolve disputes amicably. If negotiation fails, either party may bring a claim in a court with proper jurisdiction or pursue other remedies as provided in applicable law or as agreed between the parties.\n\nMiscellaneous\nIf the Company is unable to complete a charge or fulfill obligations due to force majeure or other circumstances beyond its control, we will notify users and handle the situation reasonably.\nThis Agreement, together with other agreements such as the Company’s Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and any service-specific rules posted by SlideSnap AI, constitute the complete rules governing your rights and obligations. In case of conflicts, this Agreement shall prevail unless otherwise expressly stated in other notices.\nIf you have questions regarding this Agreement, please contact SlideSnap AI customer support via the in-app support channel or through contact information published by the Company.\n\nSlideSnap team.\n","slug":"Auto-RenewableSubscriptionAgreement","date":"2026-02-06T18:00:00.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"SlideSnap AI"},{"id":"cd301cecb1486442bca8d8683070bcce","title":"SlideSnap AI Privacy Policy","content":"SlideSnap AI Privacy PolicyEffective date: January 16, 2026\nOverviewThis Privacy Policy applies to the SlideSnap AI iOS application and related services (collectively, the “Service”). It explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, how we protect it, and your choices regarding your personal information. By using the Service you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.\n1. ScopeThis policy covers information collected or processed through the SlideSnap AI app, including data you provide directly and data collected via device sensors and system permissions. It does not apply to the privacy practices of independent third parties.\n2. Information we collectWe may collect the following categories of information:\n\nAccount and registration information: name, email address, or other contact details you provide when registering or contacting support.\nDevice and technical data: device model, OS version, and basic diagnostics needed to operate and improve the app.\nUsage data: feature usage, interaction logs, preferences, and activity history within the app.\nContent data: documents, photos, images, audio recordings, notes, and any text recognized from images or audio (e.g., OCR or speech-to-text output) that you create or upload.\nLocation data: if you grant permission, the app may collect location coordinates to tag document creation or for optional location features.\nSensor&#x2F;media permission data: camera, microphone, and photo library access when you grant these permissions.\nThird-party interactions: data shared with or provided by third-party services you use through the app (for example, Gemini AI analysis).\n\n3. How we use informationWe use collected information to:\n\nProvide, operate, maintain, and improve the app and features.\nProcess content you create (e.g., run image or audio analysis to produce summaries or suggested titles).\nSupport cloud services, backups, or synchronization if available.\nRespond to support requests and troubleshoot issues.\nAnalyze usage and performance in aggregated or de-identified form.\nSend important service-related notices and security updates.\n\nNote: When you choose to send images, audio, or text to a third-party AI service for analysis (for example, Google Gemini), that content may be processed and stored by the third party according to their policies.\n4. Cookies and similar technologiesThe mobile app does not use browser cookies in the same way a website does, but embedded web views may use similar technologies (local storage, device identifiers). These are used for session management, preferences, and analytics where enabled.\n5. Information sharing and disclosureWe will not sell your personal information. We may share data in limited circumstances, including:\n\nService providers: vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., AI processing such as Gemini, cloud storage, analytics, crash reporting). They are authorized to use your data only as necessary to provide those services.\nLegal and safety reasons: to comply with legal obligations, respond to lawful requests, prevent fraud or abuse, or protect the rights and safety of users or the public.\nBusiness transfers: in connection with mergers, acquisitions, or sales of assets, where user data may be transferred as part of the transaction.\nAggregated&#x2F;anonymous data: we may share anonymized or aggregated information for research or analytics.\n\n6. Data retention and deletionWe retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. User-created content (documents, media) is kept on-device or in customer-controlled storage until you delete it or your account is terminated. If you request deletion, we will take reasonable steps to remove your data from active systems and backups within a practical timeframe.\n7. SecurityWe implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. These measures include encrypted network channels (HTTPS&#x2F;TLS), access controls, and secure development practices. No system is completely secure; if a breach occurs, we will notify affected users in accordance with applicable law.\n8. Third-party servicesThe app may integrate or call third-party services (for example, Google Gemini for AI analysis, cloud storage, or analytics). When you use features that rely on third-party services, content you provide for processing may be transmitted to and temporarily stored by those providers. Please consult the respective third party’s privacy policy for details.\n9. Children and minorsThe Service is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or higher age where required by local law). If a parent or guardian believes we have collected information about a child, please contact us to request deletion.\n10. Policy changesWe may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in practices or legal requirements. Material changes will be communicated via the app or other reasonable channels, and the effective date at the top of this policy will be updated.\n11. Your rights and choicesDepending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below; we will verify your identity before processing requests.\n12.

Purchases tied to an Apple ID will not appear under a different Apple ID.\nIf you subscribed without signing into a SlideSnap account in-app (some App Store purchases can be made while logged out), link your purchase to your SlideSnap account by signing in with the same Apple ID or follow the in-app instructions to restore purchases.\nIf you restored purchases and still do not see subscription benefits, try the following:iOS: Open the SlideSnap app → Profile (or Settings) → Restore Purchases.\n\nIf problems persist, please send us a screenshot of your subscription listing (from Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions) and your SlideSnap account email to hbhuisheng@gmail.com.\nWhy was I charged more than I expected?\nCheck whether you purchased a monthly plan, an annual plan billed upfront, or a promotional bundle—annual or multi-month plans are charged once for the whole period and may appear as a larger single charge.\nReview your App Store receipt for the exact amount and billing period.\n\nIf you believe the charge is incorrect, follow the refund steps above or contact hbhuisheng@gmail.com with your receipt.\nWhat are auto‑renewable payments?SlideSnap uses auto-renewable subscriptions on iOS.

Depending on Apple’s billing rules, changes may take effect immediately with a prorated charge, or at the next billing cycle. Check the in-app upgrade flow for specifics.\nDowngrade: If you switch to a lower-priced plan, the change may take effect at the next renewal date. If in doubt, cancel your current plan and subscribe to the desired plan.\n\nI encountered errors while attempting to make a payment on iOS.\n\nEnsure your Apple ID payment method is valid and has sufficient funds.\nRestart the App Store and the SlideSnap app, then try again.\nSign out and back into your Apple ID if necessary.\nIf you see an App Store error, follow Apple’s guidance or contact Apple Support: https://support.apple.com/contact\n\nIf the issue appears specific to SlideSnap (app crash, restore purchases failing), please send screenshots, the device model, iOS version, and a short description to hbhuisheng@gmail.com so we can investigate.\nAdditional notes\nApp Store purchases are subject to Apple’s policies. SlideSnap can assist with account linking, restoring purchases, and providing receipts, but App Store billing and refunds are handled by Apple.\nFor account or subscription linking issues, use the app’s “Restore Purchases” function and contact hbhuisheng@gmail.com if you need further help.\n\nContactFor further assistance, email SlideSnap support: hbhuisheng@gmail.com\n","slug":"SubscriptionManagement","date":"2026-02-06T18:00:00.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"SlideSnap AI"},{"id":"503f0900269106877f7bfbbcb66fa0dc","title":"SlideSnap AI Terms of Use","content":"SlideSnap AI Terms of UseEffective date: January 16, 2026\nPlease read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully before using the SlideSnap AI mobile application (the “App”).
