If you do not cancel and a charge occurs, the Company will continue service for the paid period after a successful charge.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Agreement-Amendments\"><a href=\"#Agreement-Amendments\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Agreement Amendments\"></a>Agreement Amendments</h2><ol>\n<li>The Company may amend this Agreement in response to internet development, legal&#x2F;regulatory changes, or business needs.
