It explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, how we protect it, and your choices regarding your personal information. By using the Service you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-Scope\"><a href=\"#1-Scope\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1. Scope\"></a>1. Scope</h2><p>This policy covers information collected or processed through the SlideSnap AI app, including data you provide directly and data collected via device sensors and system permissions. It does not apply to the privacy practices of independent third parties.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-Information-we-collect\"><a href=\"#2-Information-we-collect\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2. Information we collect\"></a>2. Information we collect</h2><p>We may collect the following categories of information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account and registration information: name, email address, or other contact details you provide when registering or contacting support.</li>\n<li>Device and technical data: device model, OS version, and basic diagnostics needed to operate and improve the app.</li>\n<li>Usage data: feature usage, interaction logs, preferences, and activity history within the app.</li>\n<li>Content data: documents, photos, images, audio recordings, notes, and any text recognized from images or audio (e.g., OCR or speech-to-text output) that you create or upload.</li>\n<li>Location data: if you grant permission, the app may collect location coordinates to tag document creation or for optional location features.</li>\n<li>Sensor&#x2F;media permission data: camera, microphone, and photo library access when you grant these permissions.</li>\n<li>Third-party interactions: data shared with or provided by third-party services you use through the app (for example, Gemini AI analysis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3-How-we-use-information\"><a href=\"#3-How-we-use-information\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3. How we use information\"></a>3. How we use information</h2><p>We use collected information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide, operate, maintain, and improve the app and features.</li>\n<li>Process content you create (e.g., run image or audio analysis to produce summaries or suggested titles).</li>\n<li>Support cloud services, backups, or synchronization if available.</li>\n<li>Respond to support requests and troubleshoot issues.</li>\n<li>Analyze usage and performance in aggregated or de-identified form.</li>\n<li>Send important service-related notices and security updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: When you choose to send images, audio, or text to a third-party AI service for analysis (for example, Google Gemini), that content may be processed and stored by the third party according to their policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-Cookies-and-similar-technologies\"><a href=\"#4-Cookies-and-similar-technologies\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"4. Cookies and similar technologies\"></a>4. Cookies and similar technologies</h2><p>The mobile app does not use browser cookies in the same way a website does, but embedded web views may use similar technologies (local storage, device identifiers). These are used for session management, preferences, and analytics where enabled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-Information-sharing-and-disclosure\"><a href=\"#5-Information-sharing-and-disclosure\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"5. Information sharing and disclosure\"></a>5. Information sharing and disclosure</h2><p>We will not sell your personal information. We may share data in limited circumstances, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service providers: vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., AI processing such as Gemini, cloud storage, analytics, crash reporting). They are authorized to use your data only as necessary to provide those services.</li>\n<li>Legal and safety reasons: to comply with legal obligations, respond to lawful requests, prevent fraud or abuse, or protect the rights and safety of users or the public.</li>\n<li>Business transfers: in connection with mergers, acquisitions, or sales of assets, where user data may be transferred as part of the transaction.</li>\n<li>Aggregated&#x2F;anonymous data: we may share anonymized or aggregated information for research or analytics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"6-Data-retention-and-deletion\"><a href=\"#6-Data-retention-and-deletion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"6. Data retention and deletion\"></a>6. Data retention and deletion</h2><p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. User-created content (documents, media) is kept on-device or in customer-controlled storage until you delete it or your account is terminated. If you request deletion, we will take reasonable steps to remove your data from active systems and backups within a practical timeframe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-Security\"><a href=\"#7-Security\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"7. Security\"></a>7. Security</h2><p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. These measures include encrypted network channels (HTTPS&#x2F;TLS), access controls, and secure development practices. No system is completely secure; if a breach occurs, we will notify affected users in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-Third-party-services\"><a href=\"#8-Third-party-services\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"8. Third-party services\"></a>8. Third-party services</h2><p>The app may integrate or call third-party services (for example, Google Gemini for AI analysis, cloud storage, or analytics). When you use features that rely on third-party services, content you provide for processing may be transmitted to and temporarily stored by those providers. Please consult the respective third party’s privacy policy for details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9-Children-and-minors\"><a href=\"#9-Children-and-minors\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"9.
